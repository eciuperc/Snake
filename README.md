# Snake
Here is a snake game I made using a free C++ library named SFML, with which you can create a window and display anything you want on it

The commands are very simple:
- Z,Q,S,D to move the Snake
- P to pause the game
- X to quit the game

The SFML files are not provided with the github. However, you can easily install them and integrate them to your solution by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axIgxBQVBg0&list=PL21OsoBLPpMOO6zyVlxZ4S4hwkY_SLRW9&ab_channel=HilzeVonck.

If you see any bug, please don't hesitate to tell me :)
